# ARM Assembly Language Labs Portfolio

A collection of four hands-on labs focused on ARM Cortex assembly language, designed to develop a deeper understanding of computer architecture and bare-metal programming.

The exercises were implemented using inline assembly within C, bridging high-level and low-level programming concepts.

# Contents

- [Lab 1: simple computation](lab-1-simple-computation)
- [Lab 2: stack-register transfer](lab-2-stack-register-transfer)
- [Lab 3: conditional branch](lab-3-conditional-branch)
- [Lab 4: subroutines](lab-4-subroutines)

## Highlights

- Learned the principles of register usage to implement straightforward tasks
- Gained knowledge of transferring data between registers and main memory and using pointers
- Controlled program's flow with conditional statements
- Implemented subroutines for repetitive task execution
